    <h1>Beef Burger</h1>
    <img src="imgs/beef-burger.jpg" alt="beef-burger">
    <p>A beef burger is a food consisting of fillings —usually a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. Burgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A burger topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.</p>
    <p>This thick, juicy, succulent burger is grilled to perfection, then topped with smokey bacon and sharp Cheddar cheese. You'll love the taste and texture of the home-ground meat!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound beef sirloin, cubed</li>
        <li>¼ pound beef chuck, trimmed and cubed</li>
        <li>¼ pound beef brisket, trimmed and cubed</li>
        <li>4 seeded kaiser buns, split</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>16 thick slices center-cut bacon</li>
        <li>4 slices sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon mustard</li>
        <li>4 slices dill pickle, chopped</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>8 slices beefsteak tomato</li>
        <li>4 leaves lettuce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place feed shaft, blade, and 1/4-inch die of meat grinder in the freezer until well-chilled. Arrange beef sirloin, beef chuck, and beef brisket chunks on rimmed baking sheet, leaving space between each piece and freeze for 10 minutes until meat is firm, but not frozen.</li>
        <li>Combine beef and pass meat through grinder twice. Shape ground meat evenly into four patties about 2 inches thick and 5 inches wide. Refrigerate until ready to grill.</li>
        <li>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Brush kaiser buns with melted butter.</li>
        <li>Arrange bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Toast buns on the preheated grill until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from grill and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place beef patties on the grill and cook until burgers are hot and slightly pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Top each patty with a slice of Cheddar cheese and continue cooking until cheese is melted, about 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Stir mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, dill pickle, garlic powder, and paprika in a bowl; spread mixture over toasted buns. Place patties on prepared kaiser buns and season with salt and pepper. Top burgers with 4 slices bacon, 2 slices tomato, and 1 lettuce leaf.</li>
    </ol>
